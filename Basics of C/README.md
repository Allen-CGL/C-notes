 Introduction about C
# Data Types and Variables
int:
1. Used for variables that will store intergers.
2. Always take up 4 bytes (32 bits) of memory. Meaning the range of values they can store is necessarily limited to 32 bits worth of information.

unsigned int:
1. Unsigned is a qualifier that can be applied to certain types (including int), which effectively doubles the positive range of variables that type, at the cost of disallowing any negative values.
2. Other qualifiers like short, long, and const.
